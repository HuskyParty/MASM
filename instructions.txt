         Elementary Arithmetic     by Wile E. Coyote
Enter 3 numbers A > B > C, and I'll show you the sums and differences.
First number: 20
Second number: 10 
Third number: 5

20 + 10 = 30
20 - 10 = 10
20 + 5 = 25
20 - 5 = 15
10 + 5 = 15
10 - 5 = 5
20 + 10 + 5 = 35

Thanks for using Elementary Arithmetic!  Goodbye!
